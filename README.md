# Prediction of Solar Suitability for Roof tops using Solar Pvs ( Data Anlyis, Machine learning model, Interactive Dashboard creation Using Power BI)
# Project Overview

The aim of this project to adopt Machine learning and Exploratory data analysis in
predicting if the properties are suitable or not suitable for installation of solar PVs based on the
condition which properties requires some features to qualify for solar installation using the
machine learning algorithm was demonstrated.
